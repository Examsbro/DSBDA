 Create new sheet and rename as patient count ,set the font style,size,color
 Drag sheet1(count) to rows then select text table
 Right click on count(50) format select worksheet -> change font color and size
Then go to allignment -> pane-> center
step:-2
 Duplicat patient count and rename avarage age
 Remove previous sheet count by draging left side of the screen
 Drag age to rows and convert SUM( age) to AVG(age)
 Right click on avarage age format select worksheet -> change font color and size
Then go to allignment -> pane-> center
STEP 3:
 Duplicat average age and rename avarage Hemoglobin
 Remove previous sheet average age by draging left side of the screen
 Drag age to rows and convert SUM( Hemoglobin) to AVG(Hemoglobin)
 Right click on avarage Hemoglobin format select worksheet -> change font color and size Then go to
allignment -> pane-> center
Step:-4
 Duplicate average Hemoglobin and rename average Glucose
 Remove previous sheet average Hemoglobin by draging left side of the screen
 Drag age to rows and convert SUM( Glucose) to AVG(Glucose)
 Right click on avarage Glucose format select worksheet -> change font color and size Then go to
allignment -> pane-> center
Step:-5
 Click on dash board symbol.
 Click on objects->Text and type Patient blood test analysis dash board.
 Right Click on patient blood test analysis dash board ->size-> change maximum size to 950px
 Drag from sheets paitent count,average age, average hemoglobin,average Glucose .
 Select patient count window and right click and select fit-> fit width
 Select Average age window and right click and select fit-> fit width
 Select Average Hemoglobin window and right click and select fit-> fit width
 Select Average Glucose window and right click and select fit-> fit width
Step:6
 Select new sheet and name it as count of patient by gender

 Go to dash board and from sheets drag WBC VS PATELETS to the down of the avg hemoglobin.
Step 9:- Select age distribution sheet and rename it as cholesterol insights
 Drag cholesterol to columns
 Select histogram and click on swap rows and column symbol
Go to dash board and from sheets drag cholesterol insights to the down of the avg glucose
